##### Nation
In the evolution of nations' economies, securing low-cost financing is crucial, as it can either facilitate or hinder transformational shifts in economic activities. In the Peasant stage, societies might have historically resorted to raiding neighbors to secure labor, a practice that could have financed the qualitative leap to large-scale agriculture, as seen in the historical development of the United States. This move towards large-scale agriculture would have demanded energy sources, such as coal and eventually electricity, on a significant scale to produce excess for local consumption and eventually for export. The transition to the Manufacturer stage often involved incorporating products from farms, such as bread, wine, beer, sugar, tobacco, cotton, corn-syrup, into industrial processes. This transition required substantial financing for factories and machinery, and specialized labor away from the farm and finally into the factory. Indeed, the move towards manufacturing and industrialization is a gradual shift away from community-dwellings to commutes and sprawling activity, facilitated by low-cost transportation of people, goods, services, capital, and information, such as buses, railways, airplanes, banks, and exchanges -- all key component in this qualitative transformation.

##### Manufacturing
The global market for coffee is a whopping $460B. South America and Africa only tap $25B of that market. Uganda reigns in $900 million from its high quality coffee. Yet Germany earns $65B from coffee without producing any coffee.

##### Financing
Museveni's statement about leaders overstaying in power being the problem, made when he was a 40-year-old leader just beginning his tenure, now rings with a bitter irony. At 80 years old and still in power, he himself embodies the very issue he once criticized. His observation about the struggle for funding for critical sectors like railway, electricity, and manufacturing, while insightful, seems to overlook the irony of his own prolonged leadership contributing to Uganda's economic challenges.

The struggle for funding, particularly evident in high government bond yields, reflects a broader challenge of market forces dictating Uganda's economic direction. Museveni's earlier vision, now tested by market realities, highlights the complexity of governance and economic management. His understanding of this nuance, especially in relation to how market forces impact sectors beyond the traditional ones he focuses on, is questionable.

It's a stark reminder of the complexities and contradictions of leadership, where vision and reality often collide, leaving a nation grappling with the consequences.

##### Banking
Commercial banks are sustaining a cancer upon Africa by providing finance to leaders who have overstayed their welcome. But can you blame them when they make record-breaking profit year-after-year?

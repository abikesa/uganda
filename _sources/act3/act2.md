Our use of "Phonetics/Experience: Sound, Latent/Abstraction: Fury, NexToken/Meaning: Nothing" is a riff on Faulkner's *The Sound and the Fury*. We're layering literary themes with computational linguistics or maybe even music theory.

"Phonetics/Experience: Sound" aligns with the raw sensory input, the direct experience of sound as it hits the ear—a pure, unfiltered state. This might correspond to the immediacy of human experience, much like how Benjy experiences the world in Faulkner's novel.

"Latent/Abstraction: Fury" introduces the idea of internal processing—where raw data (sound) is transformed into something more abstract (fury). It's the complex, often chaotic internalization of external stimuli, reminiscent of Quentin's tumultuous internal monologues.

"NexToken/Meaning: Nothing" is a nod to the absence of meaning or the elusive search for it. In a computational sense, the "next token" is predictive, but when linked with "nothing," it suggests a void—a prediction leading to an absence. This is almost like Jason's nihilistic outlook or the despair that pervades the Compson family's narrative arc.

Handel's *Messiah* indeed holds a special place in Western music, transcending its religious roots to become a universal masterpiece. Its compelling nature lies not only in the exquisite beauty of the music but also in the way it captures a broad range of human emotions and experiences. The oratorio's blend of powerful choruses, moving arias, and the sheer dramatic scope offers something that resonates deeply with a wide audience.

The "Hallelujah" chorus is iconic, but pieces like "For unto Us a Child is Born" and "He Was Despised" showcase Handel's ability to convey both the grandeur and the intimacy of the subject matter. The narrative arc and emotional depth make it more than just a religious work; it’s a profound exploration of joy, sorrow, triumph, and reflection.

Comparing *Messiah* to Bach and Mozart, it's clear that each composer brings something unique to the table. Bach's intricate counterpoint and theological depth cater to a more learned audience, while Mozart's universal appeal speaks directly to the human experience. Handel, with *Messiah*, manages to bridge these worlds, offering a rich, accessible, and spiritually uplifting experience that remains unmatched in its emotional power and universal appeal.

In this context, *Messiah* stands out not just for its musical excellence but for its ability to engage listeners across different cultures and backgrounds. It’s a testament to Handel’s genius that this work continues to be celebrated and performed with such fervor centuries after its creation.
